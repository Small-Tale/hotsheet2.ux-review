# Test coverage

Each feature gets both unit tests and end-to-end tests. Tests live in
`macos/Tests/UXReviewKitTests/` unless noted, and all of them run in `scripts/check.sh`.

## HS2-3ZSBZ9: repository foundation

- **Review bundle model and spec** (`ReviewBundleTests`):
  - the shared example decodes and validates, and round-trips losslessly
  - the encoder's output matches the committed example
  - the schema's enums match the model
  - Codable defaults and unknown shapes are handled
  - bounds projection per shape, including degenerate and clamped cases
  - default and explicit intents
  - The full JSON Schema validation of the examples runs in `scripts/check.sh` (ajv).
- **Validation** (`BundleValidationTests`): every `BundleIssue` rule, including boundary cases
  (an instant time range at the end of the clip, the out-of-bounds edge).
- **Ticket composition** (`TicketComposerTests`):
  - the full body for the example
  - the Hot Sheet projection, including the snake_case wire format
  - optional sections omitted
  - time formatting
- **CLI transport** (`HotSheetCLIClientTests`, using a fake process runner that matches real
  `hotsheet-cli` output):
  - bound arguments and `--` before files
  - AI actor environment removed from the child process
  - slug parsing, failures, and unexpected output
- **Discovery** (`HotSheetLocatorTests`, `HotSheetStatusTests`):
  - CLI lookup order
  - store as itself, pointer file found by walking up, sibling `.hs2`, `$HOTSHEET_STORE`, stale
    pointer
  - regression: the walk from a directory URL terminates at `/`
  - each status state
- **Submission** (`ReviewSubmitterTests`): one-batch attach, `review.json` contents, nothing
  written for an invalid bundle or missing media, no attach after a failed create.
- **End to end** (`HotSheetEndToEndTests`): submits the example bundle through the real
  `hotsheet-cli` into a freshly initialized store, then reads the ticket back. It checks the
  title, category, tag, all three attachments in one labeled `problem_evidence` batch with a
  `human` actor, the instructions and annotation sections, and that the stored `review.json` is
  byte-identical to what was written. The test is required in the gate
  (`UXREVIEW_REQUIRE_HOTSHEET=1`).
- **App** (`scripts/check.sh`): builds `UXReview.app` with Xcode and runs `UXReview --status`
  against a throwaway store, checking that it resolves the store. Menu UI tests and visual QA are
  tracked in `HS2-HA9TW3`.

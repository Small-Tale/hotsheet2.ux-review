## Hot Sheet — ticket workflow

This project tracks work as **Hot Sheet** tickets (plain files under the store). Use them to
know what to do next and to record what you did. Everything below works **headless** — no
app, and no server required.

**Create tickets by default for real work — even when work is described directly to you.**
When someone asks you to do something in this terminal (not through the Hot Sheet queue),
open a ticket before you start, then work through it: **claim it** to begin, implement, set it
`completed` with a note. Do this for features, bug fixes, refactors, and any multi-step or
code-changing task. Skip ticketing only for trivial one-offs: simple questions, quick
lookups, a single-line fix, or a git commit. When in doubt, create the ticket.

**Find and plan the queue:**
- `hotsheet-cli ls --up-next` — the prioritized Up Next queue.
- `hotsheet-cli show <slug>` — read one ticket in full.
- Or the MCP tools: `hotsheet_query` (with `up_next: true`) and `hotsheet_get`.

**Claim a ticket before you work it — claiming, not `started`, is what signals live work:**
- `hotsheet-cli claim <slug> --worker <your-id>` when you begin. This atomically moves a Not
  Started ticket to **Started** *and* takes a renewable live lease that tells everyone you are
  actively on it. Always claim before you touch code. Prefer it over `hotsheet-cli edit <slug>
  --status started`, which only flips the status and does **not** claim or signal live work.
  (Self-serve the top of the queue with `hotsheet-cli claim-next --worker <your-id>`.)
- **Your worker id:** if `HOTSHEET_WORKER_ID` is set in your environment, use its value as
  `<your-id>`. Hot Sheet gave it to this session and releases whatever it still holds when the
  session ends. Otherwise choose one stable id for the session.
- `hotsheet-cli renew <slug> --worker <your-id>` during long work; `hotsheet-cli release <slug>
  --worker <your-id>` whenever you stop working it (see below).
- **Estimate non-trivial work.** When you claim a ticket that is not trivially simple, add
  `--eta <duration>` (for example `--eta 45m`; MCP `eta`) with your honest estimate of when
  you will finish. If `renew` reports that the ETA has passed, renew again with a new `--eta`.
- `hotsheet-cli edit <slug> --status completed --note "what you did"` when done.
- On git-backed Started tickets, keep `started_phase` current with
  `hotsheet-cli edit <slug> --started-phase <analyzing|planning|working|initial_testing|integrating|final_testing>`.
  The phase is durable progress; only the live claim signals active work.
- Or the MCP tools: `hotsheet_claim_next` / `hotsheet_renew` / `hotsheet_release` for the lease,
  and `hotsheet_update` (it takes a `note`) / `hotsheet_close`.
- Create work with `hotsheet-cli new --title "…" --category <bug|feature|task>` or
  `hotsheet_create`.

**Release your claim the moment you stop working a ticket — every time, for any reason.** A
live claim tells people and other agents that someone is actively on that ticket, and it blocks
them until its lease expires. Release it (`hotsheet-cli release <slug> --worker <your-id>` or
`hotsheet_release`) as soon as you stop: you completed it, hit a blocker or `FEEDBACK NEEDED`,
are handing it off, are switching to a different ticket, decided to defer or not continue it,
ran out of time or budget, or are about to end your turn or session. Releasing never changes
the ticket's status; a ticket you set down part-way stays `started`, so add a note saying
where you stopped. Before your final response, run `hotsheet-cli ls --claimed` and release
every claim you hold but are no longer actively working.

**Create every follow-up immediately, without asking.** As soon as you identify an
unfinished step, open question, known gap, out-of-scope task, or designed-but-unbuilt
behavior, create its ticket rather than leaving it in a comment, TODO, or note. Do not ask
permission or promise to file it later. Reference every follow-up slug in the current
ticket's completing note, then continue.

**Before completing a ticket:** finish and verify its scope; update the tests, coverage, and
docs the change requires; scan for placeholders, TODO/FIXME, stubs, and documented-but-
unbuilt behavior; create a follow-up for every incomplete item; and put the result,
verification, and all follow-up slugs in the completing note. `FEEDBACK NEEDED` is only for a
blocker on the *current* ticket that needs a user decision or unavailable external state —
leave that ticket `started`, name the blocker, and release its lease (`hotsheet-cli release`).
It does not replace follow-ups for independently describable work.

**Integrate worktree and background-agent work before you complete its ticket.** Work done in a
git worktree, on a side branch, or by a sub-agent or background worker is not done until it is
on the branch this project ships from. Before marking the ticket `completed`:
1. Merge, rebase, or cherry-pick that work into the main checkout's branch, or open the
   project's pull request when that is its convention.
2. Confirm the commit is reachable there (`git branch --contains <sha>`), pushed wherever this
   repository pushes, and that the gates pass on the integrated result.
3. Name the integrated commit(s) in the completing note, then remove the finished worktree.

A delegated worker's report that it "completed" a ticket is not completion: the agent that owns
the ticket verifies the integration itself. If integration fails or needs a decision, leave the
ticket `started` with a note naming the branch, worktree path, and commit instead of completing
it. When other agents share your checkout, stage and commit only your own files (explicit
paths, never a directory-wide `git add`), and check the staged diff for changes you did not make.

**Share preliminary thoughts on non-trivial tickets.** After your initial analysis of a
ticket that is not trivially simple, and before you implement, add a short `regular` note
headed `## Preliminary thoughts`: your understanding of the problem (or likely root cause),
the approach you plan, the main risks or open questions, and how you will verify it. It lets
people steer early and gives a later reader your starting reasoning. Skip it for trivial
tickets (a quick, obvious change); never let it replace a `FEEDBACK NEEDED` blocker.

**Report completion confidence.** When you move a ticket to `completed`, the completing note
must include a `## Confidence` section: the integer score (0-100), then one short line per
factor, each rated high/medium/low with a phrase — clarity of the request; context and
supporting information available; comprehensiveness and realism of verification (unit, E2E,
real-browser visual QA; actually ran vs. assumed); scope deviation or unverified assumptions;
known gaps deferred to follow-ups. Pass the same integer in that same update as
`--note-confidence <0-100>` (MCP `note_confidence`) so clients never parse prose. Anchor
bands: **90-100** fully verified end to end against the real system; **70-89** verified with
minor assumptions; **40-69** partially verified or an ambiguous ask; **below 40** largely
unverified — name the gaps. A bare number without the factor lines is non-compliant.
Identify yourself as the AI actor: sessions Hot Sheet launches already set
`HOTSHEET_ACTOR_ROLE=ai`, and generated MCP configs declare it for `hotsheet-mcp`;
otherwise pass `--actor-role ai --actor-id <your-id>` (MCP `actor_role: "ai"`,
`actor_id`). An AI completion without a score is rejected with
`confidence_required` and changes nothing; retry the same call with the score.

**Format AI-authored notes for human scanning.** Lead with the outcome or decision, not a
chronological transcript. For a substantial note, use short Markdown sections such as
`## Result`, `## Verification`, and `## Follow-ups`; use bullets for parallel facts,
numbered lists only for a real sequence, and tables only when they clarify a dense
comparison or timeline. Break long prose into short paragraphs and format commands, paths,
and ticket slugs as code. Never leave an undifferentiated text/log dump or one dense
paragraph. Keep simple updates brief and omit empty sections.

Normally continue until every actionable Up Next ticket is complete. Read the whole queue
before choosing an order; weigh dependencies, overlap, risk, and safe parallelization. Treat
priority as important guidance, not a hard rule. The CLI and MCP tools use the same engine —
use whichever is handier.

**Write portable durable references.** In documentation, ticket text, and notes, never copy a
developer-specific home directory, username, or absolute clone path. Use repository-relative
paths, a stable repo name/URL, or a placeholder such as `<repo-root>/path`. Keep an exact
local path only as clearly labeled machine-local diagnostic evidence.

## Testing

- **Double coverage:** cover each feature with both unit tests (logic in isolation, external
  dependencies mocked) **and** end-to-end tests (real user flows through the running system,
  minimal mocking). Keep test fakes faithful to the real contract — same shapes, fields, and
  status codes.
- **Coverage is a floor, not a ceiling.** 100% lines means every line *ran*, not that every
  *behavior* — or every *sequence* of behaviors — is *asserted*. It is blind to missing state
  transitions.
- **Stateful code gets transition-matrix + adversarial tests.** For anything with modes, a
  cache, or a state machine, enumerate the states *and* the transitions, then walk realistic
  multi-step sequences that cross boundaries. Deliberately try to break it with out-of-order,
  interleaved, repeated, and empty-then-refill sequences; pin any bug you find as a permanent
  regression test.
- **Fix lint and type errors before finishing** — as you go, not batched.

## Requirements & docs

Keep human-readable requirements/docs as the source of truth for what the project does, and
update them **in the same change as the code**: add, remove, or modify a behavior → update
its doc in the same commit. Create a new doc for a major new functional area and cross-link
related docs.

## Commit hygiene

Keep the repo in a known-good state.

1. Implement one coherent, ticket-sized change and update its docs and tests.
2. Lint and fix every affected package; run the affected unit and end-to-end tests. Do not
   leave a lint warning or failing test behind.
3. Mark the ticket `completed` with its verification note, review the diff, and make **one
   commit per ticket** whose message names every ticket slug it addresses. Combine tickets in
   one commit only when their changes overlap so strongly that separating them would be unsafe
   or misleading.
4. Get the worktree clean before starting the next ticket.

**Final remote CI exception:** after local gates pass and the integrated commit is
pushed, a Started ticket may enter `final_testing` while its remote CI run continues.
Record the commit and run in a ticket note, release the claim, and work another ready
ticket; automatic claim-next skips final-testing tickets. Reclaim the exact ticket
when CI resolves and complete it after a green result. Repair failures caused by that
ticket's own change before completion; create a prioritized follow-up bug for an
independent failure. This does not defer local gates, integration, or pushing.

**Pushing is up to this repository.** Follow whatever push/PR/review conventions this project
already uses; this default guidance does not require or forbid pushing on its own.

## Ticket-Driven Work

Create a Hot Sheet ticket before substantial work described directly by a user, including features, bugs, refactors, and multi-step code changes. Claim it before editing, keep its phase and ETA current, and release the claim whenever work stops. A claim is the live activity signal; `claim_count` records past attempts and must not be used to infer current activity.

- Create follow-up tickets immediately for unfinished steps, open decisions, known gaps, and designed but unbuilt behavior. Include their slugs in the current ticket's completion note.
- Use `FEEDBACK NEEDED` only when the current ticket cannot proceed without a user decision or unavailable external state. Leave it Started, describe the blocker, and release its claim.
- Before completing, verify the scope, update tests, coverage and docs, scan for placeholders and incomplete behavior, and record the result, verification, and every follow-up.
- When a UI ticket has a problem or design image, capture and attach an after image of the matching component, state, and viewport. Explain any unavailable capture in the completion note.
- Name every addressed ticket slug in its commit message.
- Record `activity` notes when a meaningful subtask starts and finishes; keep repeated or reversed transitions as separate history entries. Put conclusions, decisions, and recommendations in `regular` Markdown notes, with a short activity entry pointing to them when useful.
- Give each AI-authored activity note a one-line, outcome-oriented `note_summary` in the same update as its Markdown body. Keep the summary plain text and preferably under 80 characters; put implementation and verification detail in the body.
- For multiline CLI Markdown, use `--note-file <path>` (or `--note-file -` for stdin) with real line breaks. Use `--allow-literal-backslash-n` only when literal backslash-n prose is intentional.

## Testing Philosophy

- Cover each feature with unit tests of its logic and end-to-end tests through the real shipped flow. Mock external dependencies in unit tests; keep browser fixtures faithful to real server shapes, optional fields, and status codes. Exercise each newly composed API surface against a real server as well as mocked client tests.
- Aim to cover every documented feature and reach 100% line and branch coverage. Treat those numbers as a floor: executed lines do not prove behavior or sequences. For stateful modules, enumerate states and transitions, then test repeated, interleaved, out-of-order, reset, and empty-then-refill sequences.
- Test stateful controls in both directions: control to application state and rendered output, and programmatic state changes back to live controls. Verify resets and a further edit. For custom elements, assert live properties and relevant focus/events. Check every part of a selected presentation, including icons, badges, counts, and other derived decoration.
- Exercise child actions through each shipped parent composition. A demo or isolated preview is insufficient evidence that the real parent wires an enabled control; disable unsupported controls explicitly.
- Maintain a feature-by-feature record of unit, end-to-end, and manual coverage as behavior changes. Keep a manual test plan for behavior that cannot be reliably automated. Broaden the affected-package test set for shared or high-risk changes.
- Give every code package a working local lint command and configuration when it is added. Keep lint warning-free, fix lint and type errors before finishing, and document justified suppressions.

## Requirements Documentation

Keep human-readable requirements as the source of truth for product behavior. Update them in the same change that adds, removes, or changes behavior. Create and cross-link documents for major new functional areas.

Maintain two concise AI-readable synthesis documents at project-specific, repository-relative locations:

- A codebase map of directory structure, entry points, schema, settings, build and test paths, and where to find important behavior. Update it when structure or contracts change.
- A requirements summary covering each requirements document and marking what is shipped, partial, design-only, or deferred. Update it when requirements or implementation status change.

If either document is absent, create a minimal, truthful version in the same change that first needs it; link it from the project's documentation index and record its relative path in local `hotsheet:specifics` guidance. Setup and refresh install these instructions but do not invent a map or product status. Preserve any existing document locations and prefer targeted updates over rewrites. Source requirements documents and code win if a summary conflicts with them.

<!-- hotsheet:begin section=visual-qa v=1 -->

## Visual QA

For any change that can affect a rendered interface, inspect the real result in a browser at representative wide and narrow sizes before completing the ticket. Exercise the affected states and transitions, then review readability, clipping and overflow, alignment, spacing, typography, contrast, icons, responsive behavior, and consistency with adjacent components. Fix defects, rerun affected behavioral checks, and inspect the corrected result. DOM, accessibility, style, and geometry assertions support this review but do not replace looking at the rendered page.

If the ticket has a problem or design image, capture the corresponding after state at the same component and viewport as closely as practical. Attach the image to the ticket and name it in the completion note. Screenshots supplement behavioral tests. If browser capture or attachment is unavailable after practical attempts, describe the exact blocker and leave the visual ticket open for review rather than claiming visual validation.
